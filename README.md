# mega-dots

My Flaked-out mega-dots config for managing systems and homes using Nix, Home Manager and a sprinkling of Snowfall Lib.

## Introduction

This is my personal system configuration repo that I use to build systems and homes in conjunction with Nix, Home Manager and Snowfall Lib. I started out this journey based on sheer curiosity and a desire to have a somewhat declaritive composition to system management (I distro hop - a lot). Some searching online lead me down the garden path that is Nix, and here I am. Down the rabbit hole.

I am not an expert in Nix, NixOS, Home Manager or Snowfall Lib. Nor am I a developer. Outside of my consultancy job (in a technical field so not completely in the dark), I'm a tinkerer. I'd been feeling a little burnt out and in need of something to learn in my downtime, and this project came along at the perfect time, and has genuinely brought some fun back in to computing for me. Just like the days of old, going to the local monthly computer market and picking up a fresh copy of a new Linux distro on a wad of floppies and taking it for a spin.

## Usage

I'm in the process of updating this section. Please hang tight, regular service will commence shortly.

I learn by doing. None of this would be possible without the copious ammounts of developers and repos that share their content freely for others like me to disect and study. There are many, but to name a few - shout outs go to:
